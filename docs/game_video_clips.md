# Game Video Clips

## Overview

Below are links to some of my recent officiating experiences for various game situations that I believe highlight why I will perform at a high level as a WFTDA Championship official:

## Video Example #1

??? video "Track Awareness and Attention to Detail :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈20:22 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe and use an official hand signal to indicate I am aware my jammer, White #25, cuts one of their teammates (White #314).

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Even though this detail ended up being inconsequential to gameplay, I am deliberate in my awareness of details like player positioning, and I communicate my observations in case they are consequential.

## Video Example #2

??? video "Understanding and Quickly Processing Gameplay Rules :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:11:44 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe White #30 legally block my jammer, Purple #88, out-of-bounds.
        - As Purple #88 skates in non-derby direction while out-of-bounds, I keep track of White #30 who has superior position on Purple #88.
        - White #30 will skate in non-derby direction while remaining in bounds until Purple #76 initiates a legal block that forces White #30 to place a toe stop out-of-bounds.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Although White #30 is in front of Purple #76, I am aware that Purple #76 now has superior position over White #30.  White #30 returns to a fully-in-bounds position and, now having cut Purple #76, initiates a derby action without ceding their cut.
        - While remaining in a position to follow my jammer, Purple #88, I issue a cut penalty to White #30.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        - I believe this sort of cut scenario is somewhat less common than conventional cuts, and my understanding of derby rules combined with extensive practice maintaining situational awareness of the action within my area of responsibility allowed me to make what I believe is the correct call.

## Video Example #3

??? video "Humility, Willingness to Admit I Make Mistakes :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈19:35 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I believe I initiated what was a slightly early call-off for my jammer, who had lead jammer status.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - While this is hardly ideal, I recognize I will make mistakes, and it is important to me to immediately and specifically apologize as a mechanism to acknowledge my errors and attempt to build trust with players, coaches, and my peers.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        - I want to show the people I serve that I care deeply about getting things right and that I will not use/abuse the power afforded to me as an official as a platform to insist I am correct.
        - My apology to the coach is not visible on the video stream, although you will see that I apologize to the player before approaching their bench to speak with their coach.

## Video Example #4

??? video "Use of Slow, Clear, and Visible Hand Signals #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈11:19:07 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I issue a direction penalty to Red #701 for a block in non-derby direction that causes Black #271 to go out of bounds
        - Approximately 1/3 of my game history is NSO roles, and, when I am in SO roles, I pay close attention to the actions I can take as an SO to make sure NSOs easily get the information they need.
        - I frequently and specifically practice issuing penalties with slow, clear, and deliberate hand signals while continuously moving and changing direction to mimic game situations like this.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - You will see that I slowly use the hand signal to indicate a direction penalty followed by a swoop and repeat both the penalty and swoop hand signals, all while remaining in my assigned area of responsibility (on the rear wall).

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - When I use clear and identifiable verbal and visual cues, my peer NSOs can do their jobs with less strain, promoting a better game experience for everyone.
        - Remaining in position while I issue penalties is essential to ensure I effectively officiate within my zone and allows my peer officials to remain focused on their zones.

## Video Example #5

??? video "Observing Detailed Action at High Speed and Immediately Issuing Accurate Points :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈22:42 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe my jammer, White #408, who does not have lead jammer status, initiate and successfully complete an apex jump during a call-off by Purple jammer #46.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I was able to be in a position to observe my jammer initiate the apex jump while fully in-bounds, and land one skate in bounds in front of three opposing blockers before the end of the fourth jam-ending whistle.
        - I immediately signaled the three earned points, before the third set of jam-ending whistles.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe this situation demonstrates I have the capacity to process a lot of information simultaneously, be in the precise position to observe the location of jammer and blocker hips at the exact moment the jam ends, and observe the exact position of the jammer’s feet before they leave the track and as they land.
        - Whenever possible, it’s important to me to signal points as immediately as possible as a mechanism to show players and coaches that I have confidence the points I’m reporting are accurate.

## Video Example #6

??? video "Use of Discretion and Judgment to Make a No-Call #1 :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈4:14:45 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe Black #63 move slightly in non-derby direction to initiate a block on my jammer, White #916, that causes my jammer to fall.
        - I blew my whistle to issue a direction penalty to Black #63, although I made the assessment that the contact was not the reason White #916 fell.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I determined White #916 fell because they slipped on a metal maintenance cover built into the concrete track, and used my discretion and judgment to not issue a penalty to Black #63.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While this decision may seem trivial, this game was closely contested and I felt the doubt I had about whether or not the contact initiated by Black #63 was sufficient to justify a no-call in an effort to keep skaters on the track and in competition unless I am certain a penalty should be issued.
        - After reviewing the video later in the day, I believe I made the correct call.

## Video Example #7

??? video "Track, Pack, and Engagement Zone Location Awareness :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:00:35 mark in this video, while serving as a JR and my jammer, White #33, standing in the penalty box, I raise my right hand and finger to indicate who I believe the foremost pack skater is, so I can assess the position of the front engagement zone and be sure that White #33 legally reenters the track after they are released from the penalty box.
        - I continued to monitor the foremost pack skater’s location until White #33 left the penalty box and reentered the track, which occurs at the ≈1:00:43 mark in this video.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although White #33’s reentry point is not visible in the video, I carefully monitored the position of the front engagement zone and determined that White #33 entered approximately 18.5’ in front of White #1975 (before White #1975 left the pack and enters the front engagement zone themselves).
        - I waited for White #33 to make a derby move, and they continued to skate forward instead of ceding the illegal reentry, so assessed an illegal reentry penalty to White #33.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - This is an example of the attention to detail I pay in order to ensure gameplay is safe and fair.

## Video Example #8

??? video "Awareness of the Unconventional Use of an Illegal Blocking Zone to Gain Position :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈2:20:04 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observed Black #77 initiate a jump in the apex of turns 1 and 2.
        - I observed Black #77 use their hand to brace themselves on my jammer, White #18, during their apex jump, and successfully gain position on White #18 and White #417.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While maintaining position to follow my jammer, I issued a forearm penalty to Black #77 with the additional verbal cue, “*bracing on an opponent*.”

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe this example shows I have the capacity to assess the game impact of illegal actions quickly and appropriately penalize athletes who gain an advantage using, in this case, an illegal blocking zone, even in ways that may not seem obvious.

## Video Example #9

??? video "Awareness/Tracking of a Non-Initiator Cut While Remaining in Position :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈10:23:44 mark in this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observe Black #211 initiate a block that sends Red Jammer out-of-bounds.
        - I also observe that Black Pivot gains superior position over Red Jammer just before Red Jammer is blocked out of bounds.
        - Red Jammer re-enters the track behind Black #211, and I follow Black Pivot as they skate in non-derby direction.
        - Red Jammer re-enters the track in front of Black Pivot, cutting Black Pivot, and fails to cede the cut.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although I do not issue the penalty (indicated by my not using a swoop hand signal) since some of the action occurred outside my zone of responsibility, I blow my whistle and signal to the IPRs and JR that I have sufficient information to issue a cut penalty to Red Jammer for illegally gaining position on Black Pivot.
        - Red Jammer’s JR issues the cut penalty.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe this video shows I am capable of tracking and communicating player positioning in a situation where player movement is fast, pack movement is dynamic, and officials need to communicate individual pieces of information amongst each other to make sure we, as a crew, neither issue penalties where they aren’t warranted, nor fail to issue penalties when they are warranted.

## Video Example #10

??? video "Body Positioning, Lateral Movement, Rapid Acceleration/Acceleration, Advanced Stop Techniques, and Player Positioning Awareness :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - This video clip is an entire half of a derby game from Y’Allstars 2024, where I served as a JR for Beast Side Roller Derby.
        - Beast Side fielded extremely talented and fast jammers who presented many challenges to effectively officiate.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While imperfect, I believe I did a good job maintaining position at the hips of my jammers, accurately tracking points, signaling lead jammer status accurately, and calling off jams precisely.
        - Anecdotally, the track surface was highly abrasive concrete, causing many officials and athletes to grind toe stops down to their posts and, of course, requiring replacements.
        - I adapted to the track conditions by almost entirely using hockey stops and power slides, avoiding the use of toe stops as much as possible, and ensuring I would not experience an equipment failure during gameplay.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe my ability to almost entirely use wheel-based stops with fast-moving jammers shows that I have the skating skill capacity to adapt to various track conditions and remain an effective official.

## Video Example #11

??? video "Controlled, Mid-Corner, Rapid Stop and While Maintaining Position  :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈57:45 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, my jammer, White #700 will earn lead, rapidly exit the front engagement zone, and approach the pack at high speed.
        - My jammer realizes they do not have much time before the opposing will approach the pack and score points for themselves.
        - My jammer rapidly decelerates and negotiates the pack for a few seconds before calling-off the jam.
        - The players in this game are all RCR TT skaters, making the game representative of elite-level play.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I had to rapidly accelerate to maintain alignment with my jammer on their scoring trip, respond to and match their rapid deceleration in a compressed space (the middle of a turn), maintain accurate alignment with my jammer to track earned passes, and respond to the jam call-off request immediately.
        - I used a single-leg backward plow stop technique to perform a controlled stop that allowed me to remain in position, not occupy more space than absolutely necessary, and move laterally through the apex of the turn in alignment with my jammer.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I specifically practice this exact stop technique and scenario because it is difficult to get right, and I believe this example demonstrates I exhibit the skating skills and body positioning required to officiate fast-moving derby with elite-level players and teams.

## Video Example #12

??? video "ALTR Readiness and Rapid Activation  :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈3:50:29 mark in this video, while serving as the ALTR, jam 7 of the 2nd period ends, and the rear OPR approaches me at the side of the track to indicate they need temporary relief.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - In the ALTR role, I keep myself ready to enter the game at any moment of need.
        - I was able to sit, safely remove my helmet, remove the black NSO top that covered my referee stripes, replace my helmet, and position myself for activation before jam 8 started.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I don't think it's ordinary to activate an ALTR without having to stop the game clock, and I am proud that my state of preparedness kept the game clock moving.
        - I believe this video shows an example of the importance I place on the ALTR role, how I do whatever I can to keep from disrupting game flow, and the level of readiness I maintain in the ALTR role.

## Video Example #13

??? video "Respectfully and Kindly Listening to an Unhappy Coach :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈36:57 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, I observe Green #51 force Blue #21 OOB using an illegal blocking zone (forearm).
        - Having sufficient information to determine the contact initiation and resulting game impact meet the criteria to issue a penalty, I issue a forearm penalty to green #51.
        - The jam ends a few seconds later, and the Green "A" approaches me to express that they believe the action did not have sufficient impact to warrant a penalty.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although I felt comfortable with my decision to issue the penalty, I did not argue my case to the Green "A" because I thought doing so would be counterproductive.
        - I patiently listened to the Green "A" express their disagreement/dissatisfaction, validated their argument by by nodding and saying "okay" to acknowledge their feedback.
        - The Green "A" returned to their bench and the next jam started without incident.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - For me, this action is a key element to officiating effectively and building trust with players and coaches.
        - I believed the Green "A" wanted to express their opinion to me, not argue with me, and I feel confident that arguing would have escalated the situation.
        - I estimated that Green "A" needed to express frustration, and I want to earn their trust by listening to understand them, not listening to respond to or arguing with them.
        - I believe this video shows an example of how I treat others with respect and kindness at all times, even when competitive emotions run high.

## Video Example #14

??? video "Use of Slow, Clear, and Visible Hand Signals #2 :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the 27:41 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observe Purple #07 initiate forceful contact to the head of White #215, and decide to penalize Purple #07 for a high block.
        - I use deliberately, a slow and clear and visual cue to ensure my peer officials are aware of the penalized action.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - In the course of issuing the penalty to Purple #07, several blockers skate in non-derby direction.  I make a rapid movement to accelerate laterally in non-derby direction before coming to a sharp stop in alignment with the blockers reforming rear wall.
        - Even though I had to maneuver my body rapidly, I completed the motion of the high block verbal cue while maneuvering myself.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe this video demonstrates I have the skating skills, game awareness, and specific practice in the OPR role to successfully perform several actions at once, which improves my ability to effectively officiate and support my peers.

??? video "Use of Discretion and Judgment to Make a No-Call #2 :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the 16:19 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observe White #422 initiate a block that causes Purple #117 to step the right-front wheel of their right skate OOB.
        - I monitor Purple #117's next actions and determine they cut White #422 by immediately returning to an in-bounds and upright position in front of White #422.
        - The jam ends as I'm raising my arms to issue Purple #117 a cut penalty.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I do not issue a penalty to Purple #117 under the basis that the jam ends before I could be 100% sure they were not taking action to cede the cut.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - This video demonstrates the process I use each time I observe action that may warrant a penalty, in addition to assessing game impact, making a mental note of which players took which actions, etc.
        - Each time I observe action that may warrant a penalty, I try to find any rules-supported reason that will allow me to *not* penalize a player.
        - Although this strategy isn't perfect and sometimes results in me failing to issue a penalty that I should issue, I take the act of penalizing and removing a player from the track seriously, and I would rather mistakenly leave a player on the track than erroneously send them to the penalty box and potentially impact the competitive balance of a game.

## Video Example #16

??? video "Use of Discretion and Judgment to Make a No-Call #3 :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the 37:18 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observe White #39 initiate a block that causes Purple #07 to step the left-front wheel of their left skate OOB.
        - From my point-of-view, it appeared that Purple #07 cut by returning to an upright and in-bounds position in front of White #39.
        - Purple #07 does not cede the apparent cut, and I am slightly behind a position that would allow me to accurately determine the exact position of White #39 and Purple #07.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I do not issue a penalty to Purple #07 under the basis that I was not in position to determine if Purple #07 actually cuts White #39.
        - I use a no-earned-pass visual cue to indicate to my peers that I cannot issue a cut penalty based on the information I have.
        - When I review the video, it is clear to me that I missed a legitimate cut because I was too far behind the action.
        - While I would love to be in the best possible position to observe the most relevant game action at all times, this is a case where I did not anticipate gameplay sufficiently and ended up about .5 seconds late getting to where I needed to be to observe Purple #07 cut White #39.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although I'm disappointed in myself for the mistake, I recognize I will make mistakes in every game, and I want to do the best I can to avoid worsening a situation.
        - This video demonstrates I am not going to guess at whether or not I should issue a penalty; I either have the information I need, or I don't.
        - Had I been asked about the situation by a player or coach, or had their been an OR, I would have responded by stating, "I was not in position to accurately observe the action."
        - While that response is not ideal, I would rather fall on that sword than issue a penalty without the appropriate vantage point and have my CHR have to manage complaints or an OR that asserts I was not in position to issue a penalty I just issued.
        - Anecdotally, reviewing this game footage provided an opportunity to learn to better anticipate how to position myself in similar situations.

## Video Example #17

??? video "Positioning Precision, Hustle, & Peer Communication :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - The 1:15:44 mark of this video is the start of jam 17 in period 2.
        - This is a playoff game that determines which team will earn a position in the 2024 WFTDA Global Championship Tournament.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I am the rear OPR, and although nothing extraordinary happens in this jam, I believe this jam is a good example oh how you can expect me to officiate for any level of play.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - You will observe me:
        
            1. Continuously adjusting my position to have as precise a point of view of relevant game action as possible.
            2. Using sharp movements to accelerate and decelerate, even in small spaces, to improve my positioning precision.
            3. Sprinting, even in small spaces, to be exactly where I need to be.
            4. Using lateral movement techniques like tracking, cross-pulls, and power slides that allow me to keep my body facing the pack, give me the widest possible angle to observe game action, and afford me the flexibility to quickly change direction and accelerate at any moment.
            5. Using non-standard visual cues, hand signals, and head movements to relay information to my peer officials.

        - At the 1:16:35 mark, one of the JRs issues a penalty to White #39, who appears to illegally exit the track.
        
            1. Understanding the severity of issuing a player a second penalty, especially in a playoff game, I point at the player to get the attention of my CHR so they can determine if they want to issue a second penalty (they do).

        - At the 1:16:46 mark, the front OPR issues a penalty to Purple #11 (blocker) that the front IPR repeats, in order to relay the call to the player.

            1. Purple #117 (jammer) hears the repeated penalty call, and, apparently believing they have their own penalty, leaves the track to self-report to the penalty box.
            2. Suspecting #117 may not have a penalty, I immediately start pointing and verbally relaying my observation to my peer officials who return Purple #117 to the track with only minimal impact to gameplay.

## Video Example #18

??? video "Use of Skating Techniques Recover and Maintain Accurate Positioning :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:45:47 mark in this video, while serving as front IPR, the pack is about to transition from "all" to "front." 
        - I am monitoring the pack movement and use a verbal and visual cue to inform players and officials that I temporarily assumed control of the primary pack definition responsibility from the rear IPR.
        - In the transition of the pack definition to my responsibility, Blue #26 accelerates forward more quickly than I anticipate while they chase Green jammer forward.
        - I end up slightly out of the optimal position, with Blue #26 now in front of my position and the rest of the pack gaining speed. 

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I never want to be out of position, although this sort of situation is something I routinely practice and drill so I can get back into position immediately.
        - I sprint forward to catch Blue #26 just as they begin to reduce their speed, so I transition to a power slide technique that allows me to return to the appropriate position, observe the status of the players in my zone, and stay out of the path of the Blue jammer's JR.
        - At the end of the power slide, as the JR and I approach turn 3, I use a two-stage pivot technique, shifting to my right and then back to my left to ensure I:

            1. Make sure the Blue JR has a clear path to remain in position with their jammer.
            2. Quickly shift to a position along the inside boundary, looking back at the pack, that allows me to observe the rear OPR, the status of the pack, and player actions.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - These actions may seem unremarkable, although I want to point out they do not happen, at least for me, by accident.
        - These are the sorts of skating techniques I practice every week.  I frequently study game film to understand how I can move myself to improve my positioning, develop drills that help me build new skills, and repeat the drills until I perform the actions in a game without having to think about them.
        - I share this so you are aware of the sort effort and discipline you can expect from me during my preparation to be a member of any officiating crew.

## Video Example #19

??? video "Attention to Details to Avoid Issuing a Penalty :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the 4:32 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observed Purple #48 initiate a block on White #42 with a legal blocking zone to a legal target zone.
        - Purple #48's block causes White #42 to fall on top of Purple #88 who is seemingly in a down position at the time of the contact.
        - I blow my whistle to issue a misconduct penalty to Purple #48 for blocking White #42 into a downed player (Purple #88).

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Although I blew my whistle inadvertently, I observed that Purple #88 met the criteria for "upright" at the time White #42 makes contact with them (as a result of Purple #48's block).
        - I used a non-standard hand signal (hand waive) to indicate I have no penalty to issue/report.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - The way I positioned myself allowed me to observe specific details I needed to avoid issuing a penalty, even though the contact had the visual appearance of potentially warranting a penalty.
        - This video demonstrates the close attention I pay to the details of game actions and how the results of those actions should be interpreted by the WFTDA rules.
