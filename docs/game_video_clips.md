## Video 1

???+ video "Track Awareness and Attention to Detail :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈20:22 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe and use an official hand signal to indicate I am aware my jammer, White #25, cuts one of their teammates (White #314).

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Even though this detail ended up being inconsequential to gameplay, I am deliberate in my awareness of details like player positioning, and I communicate my observations in case they are consequential.

Video 2:
- Understanding and quickly processing gameplay rules: at the ≈1:11:44 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe White #30 legally block my jammer, Purple #88, out-of-bounds.  As Purple #88 skates in non-derby direction while out-of-bounds, I keep track of White #30 who has superior position on Purple #88.  White #30 will skate in non-derby direction while remaining in bounds until Purple #76 initiates a legal block that forces White #30 to place a toe stop out-of-bounds.  Although White #30 is in front of Purple #76, I am aware that Purple #76 now has superior position over White #30.  White #30 returns to a fully-in-bounds position and, now having cut Purple #76, initiates a derby action without ceding their cut.  While remaining in a position to follow my jammer, Purple #88, I issue a cut penalty to White #30.  I believe this sort of cut scenario is somewhat less common than conventional cuts, and my understanding of derby rules combined with extensive practice maintaining situational awareness of the action within my area of responsibility allowed me to make what I believe is the correct call.

Video 3:
- Humility, willingness to admit I make mistakes, and immediately apologizing to both a player and their coach: at the ≈19:35 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I believe I initiated what was a slightly early call-off for my jammer, who had lead jammer status.  While this is hardly ideal, I recognize I will make mistakes, and it is important to me to immediately and specifically apologize as a mechanism to acknowledge my errors and attempt to build trust with players, coaches, and peers.  I want to show the people I serve that I care deeply about getting things right and that I will not use/abuse the power afforded to me as an official as a platform to insist I am correct.  My apology to the coach is not visible on the video stream, although you will see that I apologize to the player before approaching their bench to speak with their coach.

Video 4:
- Use of slow, clear, and visible hand signals to communicate information to other officials, teams, spectators, etc. while maintaining position, and keeping my focus on my assigned area of responsibility: at the ≈11:19:07 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I issue a direction penalty to Red #701 for a block in non-derby direction that causes Black #271 to go out of bounds.  Approximately 1/3 of my game history is NSO roles, and, when I am in SO roles, I pay close attention to the actions I can take as an SO to make sure NSOs easily get the information they need.  I frequently and specifically practice issuing penalties with slow, clear, and deliberate hand signals while continuously moving and changing direction to mimic game situations like this.  You will see that I slowly use the hand signal to indicate a direction penalty followed by a swoop and repeat both the penalty and swoop hand signals, all while remaining in my assigned area of responsibility (on the rear wall).

Video 5:
- Observing detailed action at high speed and immediately issuing accurate points: at the ≈22:42 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe my jammer, White #408, who does not have lead jammer status, initiate and successfully complete an apex jump during a call-off by Purple jammer #46.  I was able to be in a position to observe my jammer initiate the apex jump while fully in-bounds, and land one skate in bounds in front of three opposing blockers before the end of the fourth jam-ending whistle.  I immediately signaled the three earned points, before the third set of jam-ending whistles.  I believe this demonstrates I have the capacity to process a lot of information simultaneously, be in the precise position to observe the location of jammer and blocker hips at the exact moment the jam ends, and observe the exact position of the jammer’s feet before they leave the track and as they land.  Whenever possible, it’s important to me to signal points as immediately as possible as a mechanism to show players and coaches that I have confidence the points I’m reporting are accurate.

Video 5:
- Use of discretion and judgment to make a no-call on what has the appearance of being a clockwise block with game impact: at the ≈4:14:45 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe Black #63 move slightly in non-derby direction to initiate a block on my jammer, White #916, that causes my jammer to fall.  I blew my whistle to issue a direction penalty to Black #63, although I made the assessment that the contact was not the reason White #916 fell.  I determined White #916 fell because they slipped on a metal maintenance cover built into the concrete track, and used my discretion and judgment to not issue a penalty to Black #63.  While this decision may seem trivial, this game was closely contested and I felt the doubt I had about whether or not the contact initiated by Black #63 was sufficient to justify a no-call in an effort to keep skaters on the track and in competition unless I am certain a penalty should be issued.  After reviewing the video later in the day, I believe I made the correct call.

Video 6:
- Track, pack, and engagement zone location awareness during jammer reentry from the penalty box: at the ≈1:00:35 mark in this video, while serving as a JR and my jammer, White #33, standing in the penalty box, I raise my right hand and finger to indicate who I believe the foremost pack skater is, so I can assess the position of the front engagement zone and be sure that White #33 legally reenters the track after they are released from the penalty box.  I continued to monitor the foremost pack skater’s location until White #33 left the penalty box and reentered the track, which occurs at the ≈1:00:43 mark in this video.  Although White #33’s reentry point is not visible in the video, I carefully monitored the position of the front engagement zone and determined that White #33 entered approximately 18.5’ in front of White #1975 (before White #1975 left the pack and enters the front engagement zone themselves).  I waited for White #33 to make a derby move, and they continued to skate forward instead of ceding the illegal reentry.  I assessed an illegal reentry penalty to White #33.  This is an example of the attention to detail I pay in order to ensure gameplay is safe and fair.

Video 7:
- Awareness of using an illegal blocking zone to gain position, in a somewhat unconventional way: at the ≈2:20:04 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observed Black #77 initiate a jump in the apex of turns 1 and 2.  I observed Black #77 use their hand to brace themselves on my jammer, White #18, during their apex jump, and successfully gain position on White #18 and White #417.  While maintaining position to follow my jammer, I issued a forearm penalty to Black #77 with the verbal cue, “Bracing on an opponent to gain position.”  I believe this example shows I have the capacity to assess the game impact of illegal actions quickly and penalize athletes who gain an advantage using, in this case, an illegal blocking zone.

Video 8:
- Awareness and tracking of non-initiator cut while moving to remain in position to observe my area of responsibility: at the ≈10:23:44 mark in this video, while serving as rear OPR, I observe Black #211 initiate a block that sends Red Jammer out-of-bounds.  I also observe that Black Pivot gains superior position over Red Jammer just before Red Jammer is blocked out of bounds.  Red Jammer re-enters the track behind Black #211, although I follow Black Pivot as they skate in non-derby direction, Red Jammer re-enters the track in front of Black Pivot, cutting Black Pivot, and fails to cede the cut.  Although I do not issue the penalty (indicated by my not using a swoop hand signal), since some of the action occurred outside my zone of responsibility, I blow my whistle and signal to the IPRs and JR that I have sufficient information to issue a cut penalty to Red Jammer for illegally gaining position on Black Pivot.  Red Jammer’s JR issues the cut penalty.  I believe this video shows I am capable of tracking and communicating player positioning in a situation where player movement is fast, pack movement is dynamic, and officials need to communicate individual pieces of information amongst each other to make sure we, as a crew, neither issue penalties where they aren’t warranted, nor fail to issue penalties when they are warranted.

Video 9:
- Body positioning, lateral movement, rapid acceleration and deceleration, advanced stopping techniques, and player positioning awareness.  This video clip is an entire half of a derby game from Y’Allstars 2024, where I served as a JR for Beast Side Roller Derby.  Beast Side fielded extremely talented and fast jammers who presented many challenges to effectively officiate.  While I was anything but flawless, I believe I did a good job maintaining position at the hips of my jammer, accurately tracking points, signaling lead jammer status accurately, and calling off jams precisely.  Anecdotally, the track surface was highly abrasive concrete, causing many officials and athletes to grind toe stops down to their posts and, of course, requiring replacements.  I adapted to the track conditions by almost entirely using hockey stops and power slides, avoiding the use of toe stops as much as possible, and ensuring I would not experience an equipment failure during gameplay.  I believe my ability to almost entirely use wheel-based stops with fast-moving jammers shows that I have the skating skill capacity to adapt to various track conditions and remain an effective official.
