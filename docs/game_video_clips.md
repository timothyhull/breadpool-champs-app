## Overview

Below are links to some of my recent officiating experiences for various game situations that I believe highlight why I will perform at a high level as a WFTDA Championship official:

## Video Example #1

??? video "Track Awareness and Attention to Detail :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈20:22 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe and use an official hand signal to indicate I am aware my jammer, White #25, cuts one of their teammates (White #314).

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Even though this detail ended up being inconsequential to gameplay, I am deliberate in my awareness of details like player positioning, and I communicate my observations in case they are consequential.

## Video Example #2

??? video "Understanding and Quickly Processing Gameplay Rules :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:11:44 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe White #30 legally block my jammer, Purple #88, out-of-bounds.
        - As Purple #88 skates in non-derby direction while out-of-bounds, I keep track of White #30 who has superior position on Purple #88.
        - White #30 will skate in non-derby direction while remaining in bounds until Purple #76 initiates a legal block that forces White #30 to place a toe stop out-of-bounds.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Although White #30 is in front of Purple #76, I am aware that Purple #76 now has superior position over White #30.  White #30 returns to a fully-in-bounds position and, now having cut Purple #76, initiates a derby action without ceding their cut.
        - While remaining in a position to follow my jammer, Purple #88, I issue a cut penalty to White #30.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        - I believe this sort of cut scenario is somewhat less common than conventional cuts, and my understanding of derby rules combined with extensive practice maintaining situational awareness of the action within my area of responsibility allowed me to make what I believe is the correct call.

## Video Example # 3

??? video "Humility, Willingness to Admit I Make Mistakes :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈19:35 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I believe I initiated what was a slightly early call-off for my jammer, who had lead jammer status.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - While this is hardly ideal, I recognize I will make mistakes, and it is important to me to immediately and specifically apologize as a mechanism to acknowledge my errors and attempt to build trust with players, coaches, and my peers.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        - I want to show the people I serve that I care deeply about getting things right and that I will not use/abuse the power afforded to me as an official as a platform to insist I am correct.  My apology to the coach is not visible on the video stream, although you will see that I apologize to the player before approaching their bench to speak with their coach.

## Video Example # 4

??? video "Use of Slow, Clear, and Visible hand signals  :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈11:19:07 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I issue a direction penalty to Red #701 for a block in non-derby direction that causes Black #271 to go out of bounds
        - Approximately 1/3 of my game history is NSO roles, and, when I am in SO roles, I pay close attention to the actions I can take as an SO to make sure NSOs easily get the information they need.
        - I frequently and specifically practice issuing penalties with slow, clear, and deliberate hand signals while continuously moving and changing direction to mimic game situations like this.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - You will see that I slowly use the hand signal to indicate a direction penalty followed by a swoop and repeat both the penalty and swoop hand signals, all while remaining in my assigned area of responsibility (on the rear wall).

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - When I use clear and identifiable verbal and visual cues, my peer NSOs can do their jobs with less strain, promoting a better game experience for everyone.
        - Remaining in position while I issue penalties is essential to ensure I effectively officiate within my zone and allows my peer officials to remain focused on their zones.
