## Overview

Below are links to some of my recent officiating experiences for various game situations that I believe highlight why I will perform at a high level as a WFTDA Championship official:

## Video Example #1

??? video "Track Awareness and Attention to Detail :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈20:22 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe and use an official hand signal to indicate I am aware my jammer, White #25, cuts one of their teammates (White #314).

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Even though this detail ended up being inconsequential to gameplay, I am deliberate in my awareness of details like player positioning, and I communicate my observations in case they are consequential.

## Video Example #2

??? video "Understanding and Quickly Processing Gameplay Rules :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:11:44 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe White #30 legally block my jammer, Purple #88, out-of-bounds.
        - As Purple #88 skates in non-derby direction while out-of-bounds, I keep track of White #30 who has superior position on Purple #88.
        - White #30 will skate in non-derby direction while remaining in bounds until Purple #76 initiates a legal block that forces White #30 to place a toe stop out-of-bounds.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - Although White #30 is in front of Purple #76, I am aware that Purple #76 now has superior position over White #30.  White #30 returns to a fully-in-bounds position and, now having cut Purple #76, initiates a derby action without ceding their cut.
        - While remaining in a position to follow my jammer, Purple #88, I issue a cut penalty to White #30.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        - I believe this sort of cut scenario is somewhat less common than conventional cuts, and my understanding of derby rules combined with extensive practice maintaining situational awareness of the action within my area of responsibility allowed me to make what I believe is the correct call.

## Video Example #3

??? video "Humility, Willingness to Admit I Make Mistakes :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈19:35 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I believe I initiated what was a slightly early call-off for my jammer, who had lead jammer status.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - While this is hardly ideal, I recognize I will make mistakes, and it is important to me to immediately and specifically apologize as a mechanism to acknowledge my errors and attempt to build trust with players, coaches, and my peers.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"
        - I want to show the people I serve that I care deeply about getting things right and that I will not use/abuse the power afforded to me as an official as a platform to insist I am correct.  My apology to the coach is not visible on the video stream, although you will see that I apologize to the player before approaching their bench to speak with their coach.

## Video Example #4

??? video "Use of Slow, Clear, and Visible Hand Signals :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈11:19:07 mark of this video, while serving as rear OPR, I issue a direction penalty to Red #701 for a block in non-derby direction that causes Black #271 to go out of bounds
        - Approximately 1/3 of my game history is NSO roles, and, when I am in SO roles, I pay close attention to the actions I can take as an SO to make sure NSOs easily get the information they need.
        - I frequently and specifically practice issuing penalties with slow, clear, and deliberate hand signals while continuously moving and changing direction to mimic game situations like this.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - You will see that I slowly use the hand signal to indicate a direction penalty followed by a swoop and repeat both the penalty and swoop hand signals, all while remaining in my assigned area of responsibility (on the rear wall).

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - When I use clear and identifiable verbal and visual cues, my peer NSOs can do their jobs with less strain, promoting a better game experience for everyone.
        - Remaining in position while I issue penalties is essential to ensure I effectively officiate within my zone and allows my peer officials to remain focused on their zones.

## Video Example #5

??? video "Observing Detailed Action at High Speed and Immediately Issuing Accurate Points :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈22:42 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe my jammer, White #408, who does not have lead jammer status, initiate and successfully complete an apex jump during a call-off by Purple jammer #46.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I was able to be in a position to observe my jammer initiate the apex jump while fully in-bounds, and land one skate in bounds in front of three opposing blockers before the end of the fourth jam-ending whistle.
        - I immediately signaled the three earned points, before the third set of jam-ending whistles.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe this situation demonstrates I have the capacity to process a lot of information simultaneously, be in the precise position to observe the location of jammer and blocker hips at the exact moment the jam ends, and observe the exact position of the jammer’s feet before they leave the track and as they land.
        - Whenever possible, it’s important to me to signal points as immediately as possible as a mechanism to show players and coaches that I have confidence the points I’m reporting are accurate.

## Video Example #6

??? video "Use of Discretion and Judgment to Make a No-Call :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈4:14:45 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observe Black #63 move slightly in non-derby direction to initiate a block on my jammer, White #916, that causes my jammer to fall.
        - I blew my whistle to issue a direction penalty to Black #63, although I made the assessment that the contact was not the reason White #916 fell.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"
    
        - I determined White #916 fell because they slipped on a metal maintenance cover built into the concrete track, and used my discretion and judgment to not issue a penalty to Black #63.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While this decision may seem trivial, this game was closely contested and I felt the doubt I had about whether or not the contact initiated by Black #63 was sufficient to justify a no-call in an effort to keep skaters on the track and in competition unless I am certain a penalty should be issued.  After reviewing the video later in the day, I believe I made the correct call.

## Video Example #7

??? video "Track, Pack, and Engagement Zone Location Awareness :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈1:00:35 mark in this video, while serving as a JR and my jammer, White #33, standing in the penalty box, I raise my right hand and finger to indicate who I believe the foremost pack skater is, so I can assess the position of the front engagement zone and be sure that White #33 legally reenters the track after they are released from the penalty box.
        - I continued to monitor the foremost pack skater’s location until White #33 left the penalty box and reentered the track, which occurs at the ≈1:00:43 mark in this video.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - Although White #33’s reentry point is not visible in the video, I carefully monitored the position of the front engagement zone and determined that White #33 entered approximately 18.5’ in front of White #1975 (before White #1975 left the pack and enters the front engagement zone themselves).
        - I waited for White #33 to make a derby move, and they continued to skate forward instead of ceding the illegal reentry, so assessed an illegal reentry penalty to White #33.

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - This is an example of the attention to detail I pay in order to ensure gameplay is safe and fair.

## Video Example #8

??? video "Awareness of Unconventionally Using an Illegal Blocking Zone to Gain Position :material-cursor-default-click:"

    === "Overview :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - At the ≈2:20:04 mark in this video, while serving as a JR, I observed Black #77 initiate a jump in the apex of turns 1 and 2.
        - I observed Black #77 use their hand to brace themselves on my jammer, White #18, during their apex jump, and successfully gain position on White #18 and White #417.

    === "Outcome :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - While maintaining position to follow my jammer, I issued a forearm penalty to Black #77 with the additional verbal cue, “*Bracing on an opponent*.”

    === "Importance :material-cursor-default-click:"

        - I believe this example shows I have the capacity to assess the game impact of illegal actions quickly and appropriately penalize athletes who gain an advantage using, in this case, an illegal blocking zone, even in ways that may not seem obvious.
