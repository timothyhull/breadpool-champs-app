        Dear Breadpool (He/Him; Rose City Rollers),

        This is an automated email from Certification, designed to let you know that **REDACTED** (as a(n) Tournament Head Official) filled out an eval for Y'AllStars Southern Skate Showdown, an event from 2/22/2024 to 2/25/2024, involving 1 sanctioned games, 5 regulation games, "other" games described as "Breadpool officiated two games.  The first game was classified as other because it was a co-ed mashup, which had approximately 20 skaters on each team. The second "other" game was a co-ed game between Team Beast Side and Team Chicago." for WFTDA, JRDA, during which you served as JR, OPR.

    === "Evaluation :material-cursor-default-click-outline:"

        Here is the evaluation:

        Breadpool officiated during Y'allStars 2024 as a Jammer Ref and OPR.  As THR, I was able to watch Breadpool officate *(sic)* this 4 day tournament in these positions.  In every position he skated, Breadpool handled his responsibilities well.  He is very familar *(sic)* with the rules and has a great understanding of the impact spectrum.  He is not rushed in his calls and is very clear.  As an OPR, he is very fluid and dynamic.  He used non-standard hand signals to communicate with inside refs and had excellent communication with other refs.  He adjusts to pack changes very well as an OPR.  His positiioning *(sic)* was excellet *(sic)* as a Jam Ref and transistions *(sic)* well when the jammer is drawn back.  Breadpool would consistantly *(sic)* ask for feedback and he accepted the feeback *(sic)* well.  He participated in official reviews and provided concise answers to help the Crew Head made the necessary calls.  He also particated *(sic)* in rules discussions in between games.

    === "Broader Feedback :material-cursor-default-click-outline:"

        And here is the broader feedback:

        Breadpool didn't have any areas of improvement that were detriment to a game.  He did call off a jam early when the jammer only did one hand tap, but after the jam was called, he realized his mistake and apologized to the crew head and his jammer.  Breadpool always had a calm demeanor and a great attitude.  He never lost his cool during a stressful game.

        Cordially,
        Officials Certification

        Dear Breadpool (He/Him; Rose City Rollers),

        This is an automated email from Certification, designed to let you know that **REDACTED**  (as a(n) Crew Head Official) filled out an eval for Y'AllStars Southern Skatedown 2024, an event from 2/22/2024 to 2/25/2024, involving 2 sanctioned games, 5 regulation games, "other" games described as "1 -- our crew also officiated the fun open-gender Mardi Gras game (King Babycakes vs. Crew de Bruise), which was largely for show, where I believe Bread was sent to the box a few times by another ref, but it was MOSTLY regulation. :) " for WFTDA, JRDA, during which you served as JR, OPR.

    === "Evaluation :material-cursor-default-click-outline:"

        Here is the evaluation:

        Breadpool was a JR and OPR on my crew at Y'AllStars 2024. Breadpool is extremely strong on JR rules including star passes, lead eligibility, and points (Breadpool can always answer which skater's points were and were not earned), and he understands initiator, illegal actions, and impact well. As an OPR, Breadpool understands and issued penalties on trickier rules such as illegal assists and illegal contact for gaining speed out of bounds. His impact spectrum meshes well with that of other high-level refs I've worked with--he can defend calls and non-calls, and he does not overcall. Our crew was chosen to officiate the sanctioned Open Division final, and Breadpool was chosen to JR because he was one of the strongest JRs on the crew. Breadpool has the skating skills to manage JRing and OPRing a top-level, fast-paced open-gender game. The skaters were very knowledgable *(sic)* and vocal, and there was a degree of pressure associated with the game, but Breadpool performed very well.
        
        One moment of note was an official review requesting a call on Breadpool's jammer, when he did not quite have the angle to support a call. However, both PLTs saw the action and recommended a penalty. Breadpool was happy to have their perspective and issue the penalty on their recommendation, and went out of his way to thank them and give kudos for their support. Bread does not let ego restrict him in OR huddles and he values the input of off-skates officials. Bread is similarly kind, complimentary, and accessible to scorekeepers, and cross-trains as an SK and SBO to understand their perspective and challenges. Bread's experience in multiple officiating positions, on and off skates, give him a great understanding of game mechanics that is valuable on a crew.
        
        As the tournament progressed, our crew made a couple adjustments (for example, we slightly relaxed our insub metric to flex toward the other crews for consistency; we discussed and tweaked impact spectrum for blocking out of bounds). Breadpool adjusted well to the tournament-specific metrics. Breadpool is especially valuable as a communicator. He works hard to develop and implement clear "no call" informational signals such as initiator indications, "one hand went out," "contact to side," and others. He has very good instincts for passing on information to the HR about contact he's observing or escalation trajectories that will be helpful for speaking to the coaches so the HR can quickly address team concerns.
        
        Bread's penalty signals are clear and deliberate, and (speaking as a person who PLTs) he understands the importance of communicating his calls to the middle. Bread is also great at communicating with teams, coaches, and skaters: he is always appropriate and professional, and he treats teams and coaches as partners in facilitating great events.
