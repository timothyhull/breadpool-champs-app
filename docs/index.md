??? info "Non-Derby Officiating"

    I started officiating when I was sixteen, operating the scoreboard at high school basketball games, and I've since officiated:

    - High school football.
    - High school Army JROTC drill competition.
    - U.S. Army recreational flag football football.
    - BJJ tournaments at the local, regional, and international levels.

??? info "Derby Officiating"

    I began my derby officiating journey in August of 2022, somewhat by accident.  I did not realize what I started by accident became *the* thing I believe I was meant to do.  Since then, I've officiated 229 games (168 SO, 61 NSO).
