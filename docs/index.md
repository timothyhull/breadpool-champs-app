## About Me

=== "Introduction"

    I'm **Breadpool**(1), and after a year of specific and intense preparation for this moment, this is my application to serve as a member of an officiating crew at the 2024 WFTDA Global Championship Tournament.
    { .annotate }

    1.  !!! reference "Derby Name Meaning"

            My derby name is a combination of two things:

            1. I love to bake breads and pastries :fontawesome-solid-bread-slice:
            2. My superpower is recovering from injuries and surgeries :material-arm-flex:

    This application describes the unique person I am and why I believe TOSP, WFTDA, and the global roller derby community will benefit from choosing me to officiate at the 2024 Global Championship. The effort I devoted to preparing this application is a small representation of the work I've done to have enough knowledge, experience, credibility, and skills to be ready to officiate for the highest-level teams and games in the world.
    
    Whether or not you select me to be a member of an officiating crew, I hope the information and attention to detail in this application demonstrate how much this opportunity means to me, how badly I want to earn a place on a crew, and that I've given absolutely everything I have to warrant your consideration.

=== "WFTDA Certification"

    I am not a WFTDA-certified official at this time.  However, achieving SO and NSO certification is very important to me.  For me, becoming a certified official and continuously seeking higher-level certification is symbolic of:
    
    1. My ongoing commitment to seek self-improvement.
    2. Demonstrating I support the WFTDA and their officiating procedures.

    ??? info "Certification Timeline and Progress"

        - I started the process to become a certified official in September of 2022 by studying for and passing WFTDA's online SO and NSO officiating certification courses.
        - At the beginning of 2023, I set a personal goal to build sufficient game experience to credibly apply for Level I SO and NSO certifications.
        - At the beginning of 2024, I set a personal goal to apply for and achieve Level I SO and NSO certifications.
        - I received the final OOS I need to apply for Level I SO and NSO certifications in July of 2024.
        - I intend to complete and submit my WFTDA officiating certification applications as soon as I complete and submit my application to officiate at the 2024 WFTDA Global Championship Tournament.

            - I position myself to observe player positioning relative to the jammer line at the start of each jam.
        - As a **middle** OPR, I am, generally:
            - Parallel with a well-defined front wall of three or more blockers, ready to rapidly shift my position to observe the rear wall from the front when the front wall has fewer than three blockers.
            - I frequently make adjustments in my position
        - As a **front** OPR, I will, generally, be seven to twelve feet  with a well-defined rear of three or more blockers.

## What This Means To Me

=== "Inspiration"

    - I seek to inspire people who have physical disabilities, just like me, to do more than they or perhaps the world believes they are capable of.
    - I am a physically disabled U.S. Army veteran, and I believe I fit within the category of people with hidden disabilities.
    - When serve in an SO role, nobody sees me and thinks I’m disabled, guesses I have an extensive injury history that includes 20 x surgeries, or has any idea how much daily work I do to physically function, gear up and skate, and excel at high-intensity physical activities.
    - Intense rehabilitation to recover from injuries is my superpower. For example, I served as an SO less than two weeks after a total hip replacement last year because I spent hours and hours each day rehabilitating, strengthening, and specifically training to be ready to skate.
    - **I want people with physical disabilities to see me as an example that's it’s possible for them to experience the joy and fulfillment from strenuous sports and activities.**

=== "Hope"

    I've loved competitive athletics my whole life.  I lost the ability to compete

    Todo - I train to officiate like a competitor, like I have to be the best, like good is the enemy of great.

## My Officiating Background

=== "Non-Derby Officiating"

    I am newer to officiating for roller derby, although I am not new to officiating.  

    I’ve been competing in sports throughout my life, including over 20 years of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competition, and officiating is one of the ways I contribute to serving future generations of competitors while honoring the people who have officiated for my own competitive athletic experiences.

    I started officiating when I was sixteen, operating the scoreboard at high school basketball games, and I've since officiated:

    - High school football.
    - High school Army JROTC drill competition.
    - U.S. Army recreational flag football.
    - BJJ tournaments at the local, regional, and international levels.

    </figure>

=== "Derby Officiating"

    I began my derby officiating journey in August of 2022, although somewhat by accident.  My daughter was new to the roller derby community and wanted to spend more time on skates than was available to her in practices and scrimmages.  She decided to start attending officiating practice and asked that I join her so she wouldn't feel alone.
    
    I wanted to support my daughter and the roller derby community, and having skated and officiated in different capacities for the majority of my life, I felt comfortable giving roller derby officiating a shot.  I had no idea that I would leave that practice feeling like officiating roller derby was *the* thing I was meant to do.
    
    Since that day, I've poured my heart and soul into becoming a better official, believing I can serve people, many of whom live within social margins, in a way that allows them to live safer, more fulfilling lives.

## How I Officiate

I believe the best officiating happens when a crew behaves like a selfless, supportive, and blameless team that focuses on being better today than they were yesterday.  These are the qualities you can expect from me as a member of an officiating crew:

??? info "1. My Mindset"

    - I approach officiating just like I do playing any competitive sport, with the exception that my opponent isn't another person or team.
    - In my mind, **mistakes** are the opponent I ferociously train to beat, while recognizing mistakes are a relentless opponent that will never allow me to be rest.
    - I respect my opponent, although I do not fear them on any stage.
    - I seek to challenge my opponent at the highest levels because I'm driven to "win," and I do whatever it takes to be successful on the biggest stages.
    - "Winning" means my peers and I supported safe, fair, and gameplay in which the competing teams feel like they control the outcome.
    - I give my all to be the best teammate anyone has ever had, someone who my peers trust, feel safe with, and enjoy being around, and the most humble empathetic official anyone has ever known.

??? info "2. Extreme Positivity"

    - I show up with high enthusiasm, friendliness, excitement, and positivity to share with the officials I serve with, no matter how challenging game conditions might be.
    - Regardless of the circumstances, I bring fist bumps, high-fives, and verbal "Let's go!" cues to support and encourage my peers throughout the duration of a contest.
    - I seek responsibility for my mistakes, make in-game adjustments, avoid dwelling on my mistakes so I keep my head in the game, and immediately extend apologies, where appropriate, to the people I impact with my mistakes.
    - I have the backs of my on- and off-skates crewmates, *always*, and they can count on me to encourage them in difficult situations.
    - When my officiating peers and leadership need me to make adjustments, I don’t dig my heels in about doing things a certain way, I give them my full support and do what they need me to do.

??? info "3. Strenuous Preparation"

    - I practice developing and improving officiating skills, on- and off-skates at least 4 hours per week, and often upwards of 10 hours per week.
    - I actively seek feedback from other officials and relentlessly study game video to continuously learn and improve, and to position myself to best support safe and fair gameplay.
    - I physically train and condition 5-12 hours per week to maintain a high level of fitness, improve my ability to be in the best position to observe game action, and ensure I will not experience physical fatigue no matter how strenuous the environmental or game conditions might be.
    - I regularly study roller derby rules and cases to continuously develop a better understanding of roller derby rules theory because I believe learning to understand rules theory helps me quickly work through complex situations in a way that supports the best and safest possible gameplay experience.

??? info "4. Empathic Listening"

    - I actively listen to officials, players, and coaches with genuine effort and concern to understand their points of view.
    - I seek to build trust by showing officials and teams they are heard and understood, even in cases where we may disagree with each other.
    - I actively solicit feedback from my peer officials by telling them no feedback will hurt my feelings.
    - For me, feedback is information I can use to be better today than I was yesterday, and I want to understand my mistakes, not ignore or hide from them.

??? info "5. Clear and Kind Communication"

    - I speak to everyone with courtesy and respect, no matter how I am spoken to.
    - I do everything I can to actively communicate information with other officials in a way that promotes smooth, continuous game flow.

??? info "6. Keeping Athletes on the Track"

    - I believe gameplay is best when athletes are on the track, not in the penalty box, and I observe game action in a way that seeks to avoid issuing penalties whenever possible.
    - For any action that might create sufficient game impact to warrant penalties, I describe the game impact to myself in a way I can recite during an official review *before* I issue any penalties (e.g., "Low block on yellow 2-4; caused purple 2-4 to go down").
    - I maximize the use of verbal warnings, prescribed by gameplay rules, to help athletes avoid committing penalties.
    - When I issue penalties, I include as much "3-star" information as possible to help athletes understand my basis for issuing penalties and help them avoid being assessed with the same penalty again (e.g., "Yellow 2-4, forearm; bracing on an opponent.")

??? info "7. Zone Ownership"

    - I focus on officiating specifically within the confines of my area/zone of responsibility.
    - Said another way, I avoid immediately issuing penalties for actions I may not have the best point of view to observe during a jam.
    - If I believe I may have observed game action outside of my zone that warrants a penalty or even warrants reversing a penalty, I seek to discuss my observations with other officials during lineups to collaborate on our points of view and reach the best possible outcome.

    Santa Cruz C vs. G example with CMF.

??? info "8. Hustle"

    - No matter what I do, I move with the utmost sense of purpose, often sprinting back and forth, to show everyone around me that my concern for serving the teams and peers I officiate with is equivalent to that of the highest-level competitors.

??? info annotate "9. Versatility"

    - Although this application is specific to SO roles, I work hard to continuously build skill and experience at each officiating position, on- and off-skates because I believe learning and practicing each role helps make me a better official and teammate for my SO and NSO peers. (1)
    - I actively work to keep my OHD balanced between SO and NSO roles, officiating ≈2/3 of games in SO roles and ≈1/3 of games in NSO roles.
    - Whenever needed, I am comfortable serving in any SO or NSO role, with or without advanced notice.

1. !!! info "Caveat"

    Although I practice working with CRG extensively, including IGRF and statsbook preparation, I do not have game experience in the role of HNSO.

??? info "10. Courage To Do What's Right"

    Accept consequences for my actions.
    Santa Cruz S-OOB example.
    Rat vs. AoA example

## Conclusion

I believe the events of my life prepared me for this opportunity, for this moment.  The intersection of my choices, my experiences, my successes, my failures, my dreams, and my life's purpose combined to make this the one thing I've wanted so badly that I've poured my entire life into having the chance.

Thank you for the opportunity to apply and for considering my application.
