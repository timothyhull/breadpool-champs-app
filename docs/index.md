## About Me

=== "Introduction"

    I'm **Breadpool**(1), and, after a year of specific and intense preparation for this moment, this is my application to serve as a member of an officiating crew at the 2024 WFTDA Global Championship Tournament.
    { .annotate }

    1.  !!! info "Derby Name Meaning"

            My derby name is a combination of two things:

            1. I love to bake breads and pastries :fontawesome-solid-bread-slice:
            2. My superpower is recovering from injuries and surgeries :material-arm-flex:

    This application describes the unique person I am and why I believe TOSP, WFTDA, and the global roller derby community will benefit from choosing me to officiate at the 2024 Global Championship.

    I've spent over 40 hours preparing this application...because I want it *so* badly I can't do any less than the best I can possibly do.  That's how I've spent the last year, doing anything and everything I can to be ready for this moment, right now.  To know I gave it my all, did nothing less than my very best, and can submit this application believing nobody has trained harder.
    
    I prepared for this like a champion, and whether I make the cut or not, I will know that I had nothing left to give to show how much this means to me.

=== "Inspiration"

    - I seek to inspire people who have physical disabilities, just like me, to do more than they or perhaps the world believes they are capable of.
    - I am a physically disabled U.S. Army veteran, and I believe I fit within the category of people with hidden disabilities.
    - When I am an SO, nobody sees me and thinks I’m disabled, guesses I have an extensive injury history that includes 20 x surgeries, or has any idea how much daily work I do to physically function, gear up and skate, and excel at high-intensity physical activities.
    - Intense rehabilitation to recover from injuries is my superpower. For example, I served as an SO less than two weeks after a total hip replacement last year because I spent hours and hours each day rehabilitating, strengthening, and specifically training to be ready to skate.
    - **I want people with physical disabilities to see me as an example that's it’s possible for them to experience the joy and fulfillment from strenuous sports and activities.**

## My Background

??? info "Competitive Sports"

    For as long as I can remember, I've lived and died for athletic competition.  My competitive background includes:

    - Youth soccer, baseball, basketball.
    - Junior high school cross-country, basketball, wrestling, track and field.
    - High school cross-country, basketball, biathlon, track and field.
    - U.S. Army recreational flag football.
    - Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

??? info "Skating"

    I learned to skate when I was...

??? info "Non-Derby Officiating"

    I am newer to officiating for roller derby, I am not new to officiating.  I regularly officiate at Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournaments and have previous experience officiating for high school basketball and football.
    
    I’ve been competing in sports throughout my life, including over 20 years of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competition, and officiating is one of the ways I contribute to serving future generations of competitors while honoring the people who have been officials for my own competitive athletic experiences.

    I started officiating when I was sixteen, operating the scoreboard at high school basketball games, and I've since officiated:

    - High school football.
    - High school Army JROTC drill competition.
    - U.S. Army recreational flag football football.
    - BJJ tournaments at the local, regional, and international levels.

??? info "Derby Officiating"

    I began my derby officiating journey in August of 2022, somewhat by accident.  I did not realize what I started by accident became *the* thing I believe I was meant to do.  Since then, I've officiated 229 games (168 SO, 61 NSO).

## How I Officiate

??? info "1. Extreme Positivity"

    **Officiating is a TEAM sport for me**

    - I show up with high enthusiasm, friendliness, excitement, and positivity to share with the officials I serve with, no matter how challenging game conditions might be.
    - No matter the game circumstances, I bring fist bumps, high-fives, and verbal "Let's go!" cues to support my peers.
    - I seek responsibility for my mistakes, make in-game adjustments, avoid dwelling on my mistakes so I keep my head in the game, and immediately extend apologies, where appropriate, to the people I impact with my mistakes.
    - I have the backs of my on- and off-skates crewmates, *always*, and they can count on me to encourage them in difficult situations.
    - When my officiating peers and leadership need me to make adjustments, I don’t dig my heels in about doing things a certain way, I give them my full support and do what they need me to do.

??? info "2. Preparation"

    - I practice developing and improving officiating skills, on- and off-skates at least 4 hours per week, and often upwards of 10 hours per week.
    - I actively seek feedback from other officials and relentlessly study game video to continuously learn and improve, and to position myself to best support safe and fair gameplay.
    - I physically train and condition 5-12 hours per week to maintain a high level of fitness, improve my ability to be in the best position to observe game action, and ensure I will not experience physical fatigue no matter how strenuous the environmental or game conditions might be.
    - I regularly study roller derby rules and cases to continuously develop a better understanding of roller derby rules theory.
    - I believe learning to understand rules theory helps me quickly work through complex situations in a way that supports the best and safest possible gameplay experience.

??? info "3. Listening"

    - I actively listen to officials, players, and coaches with genuine effort and concern to understand their points of view.
    - I seek to build trust by showing officials and teams they are heard and understood, even in cases where we may disagree with each other.
    - I actively solicit feedback from my peer officials by telling them no feedback will hurt my feelings.
    - For me, feedback is information I can use to be better today than I was yesterday, and I would rather understand my mistakes than ignore them.

??? info "4. Communication"

    - I speak to everyone with courtesy and respect, no matter how I am spoken to.
    - I do everything I can to actively communicate information with other officials in a way that promotes smooth, continuous game flow.

??? info "5. Keeping Athletes on the Track"

    - I believe gameplay is best when athletes are on the track, not in the penalty box, and I observe game action in a way that seeks to avoid issuing penalties whenever possible.
    - For any action that might create sufficient game impact to warrant penalties, I describe the game impact to myself in a way I can recite during an official review *before* I issue any penalties (e.g., "Low block on yellow 2-4; caused purple 2-4 to go down").
    - I maximize the use of verbal warnings, prescribed by gameplay rules, to help athletes avoid committing penalties.
    - When I issue penalties, I include as much "3-star" information as possible to help athletes understand my basis for issuing penalties and help them avoid being assessed with the same penalty again (e.g., "Yellow 2-4, forearm; bracing on an opponent.")

??? info "6. Zone Ownership"

    - I focus on officiating specifically within the confines of my area/zone of responsibility.
    - Said another way, I avoid immediately issuing penalties for actions I may not have the best point of view to observe during a jam.
    - If I believe I may have observed game action outside of my zone that warrants a penalty or even warrants reversing a penalty, I seek to discuss my observations with other officials during lineups to collaborate on our points of view and reach the best possible outcome.

    Santa Cruz C vs. G example with CMF.

??? info "7. Hustle"

    - No matter what I do, I move with the utmost sense of purpose, often sprinting back and forth, to show everyone around me that my concern for serving the teams and peers I officiate with is equivalent to that of the highest-level competitors.

??? info "8. Versatility"

    - I am specifically applying to serve as an OPR (first choice) or JR, the positions I have the most experience with, and I am willing to and capable of serving in any position of need, on- or off-skates, demonstrating that I place the utmost value on being an excellent follower while also demonstrating  leadership whenever required.
    - I actively work to keep my OHD balanced at roughly 2/3 SO roles 1/3 in NSO roles. off-skates to be as well-rounded and knowledgeable as an official as possible, and I am currently pursuing WFTDA SO and NSO Level I certification.

??? info "9. Courage To Do What's Right"

    Accept consequences for my actions.
    Santa Cruz S-OOB example.
    Rat vs. AoA example

??? info "10. The Ultimate Teammate"

    Fist bumps, "Let's Go!", high fives, etc.
